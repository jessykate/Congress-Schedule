Suspensions
* A motion to suspend the rules is in order on Mondays and Tuesdays
  and towards the end of a session of Congress and may only be made by
  the Speaker of the House or their designee, though it is customary
  for committee chairs to write the Speaker requesting a
  suspension. Once a member makes a motion to "suspend the rules" and
  take some action, debate is limited to 40 minutes, no amendments can
  be offered to the motion or the underlying matter, and a 2/3
  majority is required to agree to the motion.
